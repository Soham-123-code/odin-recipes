    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pizza Base</strong></li>
        <li>flour(plain + wholewheat flour)</li>
        <li>flax seeds with warm water optional</li>
        <li>yeast(water +sugar)</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>water to knead into soft dough</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings</strong></li>
        <li>sauce(homemade or can)</li>
        <li>Mixed veggies sliced(capsicum, olives, mushrooms, artichokes</li>
        <li>cheddar+mozzarella cheese/ or pizza blend cheese</li>
        <li>dried oregano flakes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sugar to lukewarm water, mix until it dissolves. Now, add the yeast to sugar water, so that it activates. This will make the mix frothy. It usually takes 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Mix the flax seed meal with Â½ cup water. Keep it aside. (optional, the addition of flax seeds is to boost the nutritional value of the dough and it also helps with the texture.) </li>
        <li>Add this yeast and flax seed mix to the flour along with salt. Knead the dough, this will be sticky at the start. Add oil to it and continue kneading. </li>
        <li>Cover the dough and keep it aside to rise.</li>
        <li>The dough will rise after 45 minutes-1 hour.(I wish it took less time, but good things come to those who wait!)</li>
        <li>Make equal portions. Keep them in a floured tray. Cover with a plastic film. Keep it in fridge for 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat oil and add chopped 1 medium onion,some cloves of garlic to it. Cook until translucent. Add a can of tomatoes along with salt and basil. Keep it aside once done. You can make a batch whenever you have excess tomatoes at home. Store it in refrigerator or freezer as per your convenience.</li>
        <li>Take a portion of dough. Roll into a round flat base on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato paste and sprinkle cheese on the top generously.</li>
        <li>Spread the veggies and then cheese again on top. (The more the merrier!). Cook in a preheated oven at 200 degree C (fan forced) for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, season with dried oregano, basil leaves before serving</li>
        <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
    </ol>
